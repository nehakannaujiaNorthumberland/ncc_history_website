                <p class="govuk-body">The Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin, is the oldest of three church buildings in the Parish. Located on the southern boundary of the town,  almost one mile out of the town centre of Morpeth. Until the 1840s, as one of the finest and largest 14th century churches in Northumberland, St Mary's was the town’s main Parish Church.  Numbers after the 1840s began to fall due in no small part to its location on the southern boundary. The walk, particularly in winter, was proving too much for parishioners. A decision was then taken to build a new and more suitable church in the centre of the town, with the building of St James begun in 1844 and completed in 1846.

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">Origin</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">Many people have played a part in establishing a church on this ancient site of Kirkhill. There was an unknown evangelising monk, companion of Aidan or Cuthbert. Ranulf, the grandson of William de Merlay, one of  William the Conqueror’s officers, whose reward for quelling the rebellious Northumbrians was the Barony and lands of Morpeth. There was a group of monks from Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire where Ranulf had sought shelter in his travels, who at his invitation came north to build Newminster after the Conquest. The stone masons in the employ of the Baron may also have played their part in founding the church. Despite the devastation wrought by Scandinavian, Scottish and Cromwellian vandals and thanks to the faithful restorers of the 14th, 17th and 19th centuries, the present church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, stands witness to the gospel which has been proclaimed here for almost 900 years. However recent study has suggested that there may have been Anglo Saxon activity on the same site.</p>

          <div class="card_container">
            <div class="card-content-container">
               <p class="govuk-body">On the far South side of the churchyard is the Watch House which was built in 1830. This was used as a base from which to keep watch to prevent the removal of corpses by body snatchers. By the late 18th century, the teaching of medicine and surgery rapidly became more advanced, and as more medical schools were founded, there was a serious shortage of corpses legally available for dissection. Corpses were sold for up to £10 each to University Medical schools, although this figure was dependent on the condition of the body.

                Shortly after the Watch house was built, the Anatomy Act of 1832 gave surgeons and their students legal access to bodies from workhouses, hospitals and prisons that were unclaimed 48 hours after death. It was also made possible for a person to donate a next of kin's body for medical study.

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">Memorials in the churchyard and what they mean </h2>
         <p class="govuk-body">“A memorial is an object or place which serves as a focus for the memory or the commemoration of something, usually an influential, deceased person or a historical, tragic event”. Memorials can also be sculptures, statues, parks, fountains or other buildings.
           Larger memorials can also be called monuments.Find out more on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial"> Wikipedia</a> </p>

           <h2 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">Other types of memorials</h2>
           <p class="govuk-body">A cenotaph is a special type of memorial and usually this type of monument is erected in honour of a person or group of people whose remains are elsewhere. An example of this can be found in our town. 
            Morpeth Cenotaph is located at Castle Bank next to Mafeking Roundabout in Morpeth. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://w3w.co/purified.toward.defaults">More details on location</a></p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The town’s 16ft high Cenotaph was designed by C. Franklin Murphy and built in blue york stone by J.H. Robinson. It was unveiled on 1st October 1922 by Lord Joicey and dedicated by Canon JJ Davies. 
          Morpeth Town Council has the responsibility for managing and maintaining the Cenotaph. It plays a prominent role in the Remembrance Sunday Service each year.

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-padding-top-3">War memorials </h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">Across the uk, there are estimated to be more than 100,000 war memorials of many different types. Many war memorials have a traditional design which makes them easily recognisable. One of these is a cross, of which there are many forms, including the wheel cross, Latin cross, Calvary cross and market cross. Another design for War memorials can be in the form of a pillar or column. In particular, a pillar that looks to have been broken off is often used, with the broken pillar symbolising lives that have been cut short. The word ‘cenotaph’ derives from the Greek words for ‘empty tomb’ and the design is therefore used to commemorate
            those whose remains are elsewhere.
