                <p class="govuk-body">Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, born in Newcastle upon Tyne, 1748, was the eldest
                  son of a merchant, receiving a formal education in the Royal Grammar school,
                  Newcastle. Early in life, Collingwood began his tenure within the royal navy, at only
                  12 years old, Collingwood took service under the command of his maternal cousin-
                  Richard Braithwaite, aboard the frigate Shannon. While serving, Collingwood
                  displayed exemplary tactical insight, partaking in battles such as the Glorious first of
                  June and the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. Collingwood’s most widely
                  renowned victory is largely considered to be the success he saw during the Battle of
                  Trafalgar, 1805, a battle that acted to crown the British navy as an unrivalled force
                  around the globe- Collingwood saw a decisive victory against the Franco-Spanish
                  fleets after Admiral Nelson fell in the advent of the battle.</p>

                          His clear affinity for sea life and honourable dedication to his profession is best
                          expressed when considering his 49 years of service to the navy, only 4 of which he
                          spent on land; even taking his last breaths on the rolling waves aboard the HMS Ville
                          de Paris in 1810. Despite this, Collingwood still held great affections for his land-

                          bound Morpeth manor, Collingwood house, where his wife, Sarah Blackett; himself,
                          and his 2 daughters took residency. Northumberland and Morpeth had a particularly
                          moving effect on him despite the little time he spent on land- to this day his Oldgate
                          home bears both his name and his affections for Morpeth, the placard visible atop
                          Collingwood house reading “whenever I think how I am to be happy again, my

                          <p class="govuk-body">The Battle of Trafalgar, taking place 21 October
                            1805, was a major naval engagement of the
                            Napoleonic wars in which the British Royal Navy
                            saw resounding success over the efforts of
                            Spanish-Franco fleets. The overwhelming victory
                            of Britain played a vital role in preventing
                            Napoleon’s invasion of England by maintaining
                            British control of the English channel. Leading the British fleets, Admiral Horatio
                            Nelson, along with Admiral Collingwood as his right hand man, had the plight of
                            taking on the combined force of the Spanish and French, outnumbered 27 to 33.
                            Despite these poor odds, the careful planning of the battle led to a show of tactical
                            triumph- the British fleets were divided into two squadrons, Nelson taking command
                            of 12 ships, leading them towards the enemy flagship while Collingwood, aboard the
                            HMS Royal Sovereign, oversaw 15 ships which were tasked with taking up the rear
                            of the enemy line. During the battle, Nelson suffered a gunshot wound ultimately
                            causing his death- Collingwood adopted charge of the fleets; as a result of prior
                            strategic planning, superior gun capabilities and the vastly more experienced sailors,
                            the British reigned victorious. Trafalgar was a sweeping success, only 1,500 British
                            seamen were killed, as opposed to the enemy fleets suffering approximately 14,000
                            losses. For Collingwood’s performance, he was awarded a Baron title and granted a
                            pension of £2,000 a year. The Battle of Trafalgar acted to reinforce the Royal Navy&#39;s
                            invincibility- beginning the era of the British Navy&#39;s complete dominance in naval
                            force.</p>

                                “charming creature” in letters to his sister; a constant

                                In 1777, Aboard the HMS Lowestoffe, Collingwood met Horatio Nelson- sparking the
                                beginning of a lifelong friendship. Collingwood, despite being 10 years Nelson&#39;s
                                senior, held no feeling of contempt or competition towards the younger, even as
                                Nelson progressed in his naval career at enviable speeds. Reflective of his
                                character; Collingwood good-naturedly praised Nelson: “Lord Nelson is an
                                incomparable man, a blessing to any country…His successes in most of his
                                undertakings are the best proofs of his genius”, Collingwood wrote to Dr Alexander
                                Carlyle (August 1801).

                              Collingwood maintained a standard of generosity and fairness towards all the sailors
                              that he commanded- he was known to be opposed to cruel methods of punishment
                              such as flogging. This standard of morality he upheld gained him the nickname
                              “father” by common sailors. Sailor Robert Hay wrote in his memoir about
                              Collingwood, describing how Collingwood and “his favourite dog bounce were well
                              known to every member of the crew”, Collingwood being acknowledged as &quot;a better
                              seaman, a better friend to seamen, a greater lover and a more zealous defender of
                              the country&#39;s rights and honour, never trod the quarterdeck.&quot;
